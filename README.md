# Maze-Generation-Algorithm
The generation and representation of a 2D maze structure in Unity using my novel procedural maze generation algorithm.
Fast, sub second running time for (at least) up to 60X60 mazes.
Unlike other generation algorithms, allows for control over maze difficulty, with a harder maze having a longer main path, longer dead ends, more dead ends and less connecting paths.

Read the Data flow diagram for an overview of how it all fits together.

A modified version of this was used in my full mobile game "Crazy Mazy" to generate each level.
